## Purpose Scorecard Self-Assessment

The Purpose Scorecard evaluates alignment across six domains: **Mind, Body, Spirit, Relationships, Contribution**, and **Vitality**. Each domain contains several prompts inviting you to reflect on your behaviours, beliefs, and environment. After tallying your responses, you are guided toward one of three archetypes—*Ready*, *Build*, or *Explore*—which indicate where to focus your attention.
