## Purpose Discovery Workbook

The Discovery Workbook helps you uncover passions, strengths, "sacred wounds," and personal values. Through journaling prompts, visualisation exercises, and a contribution brainstorm, you will explore your unique gifts and the impact you wish to have in the world. A purpose statement template at the end of the workbook helps you synthesise your insights into a concise declaration of purpose.
