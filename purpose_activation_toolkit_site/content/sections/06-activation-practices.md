## Activation Practices

Sustainable change requires consistent action. Activation Practices blend daily rituals and weekly routines to help you embody your purpose. They include gratitude journaling, breath meditation, intentional movement, spoken declarations, weekly calendar review aligned with purpose, and community engagement. These practices are complemented by audio meditations and a printable Daily Alignment Checklist available in the membership portal.
