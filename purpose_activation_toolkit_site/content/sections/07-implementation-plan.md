## Implementation Plan & Next Steps

The toolkit concludes with a 30-day activation plan: review your scorecard results, work through the workbook, implement daily practices, and reassess your progress. When you are ready for deeper personalisation, the Audit provides a one-on-one consultation to interpret your results and refine your strategy. Mentorship is available for those who wish to fully embody their purpose with guidance and accountability.
